an 12x17 (16x21 for supporters) pixel PNG file.

others can see!

## NekoVM
NekoVM is a Linux emulator that runs in the browser, with Node.js, NPM and full read/write access.

NekoVM is used to build sites with static site generators or frameworks, and has (as stated by Dimden) support for any static site generator or framework.

Currently, you can launch NekoVM 1 time per 1 minute. But if you are a donator, you can launch NekoVM 2 times per 1 minute.

## History of NekoVM
- **08/04/24**: dimden announces that NekoVM is added:

  > most importantly, an actual gamechanger: introducing NekoVM, a Linux with Node.js and NPM running inside your browser, with full read/write access to your site filesystem.
  > 
  > what this means? you can now use any static site builder or framework to build your site. literally any framework, fr like actually! available to everyone too, not just donators!
  > theres also support for local port forwarding so you can for example run vite dev server with frameworks that support it :OOO
  >
  > this is still beta. report any bugs when u see them and backup ur site before doing anything in terminal. you can launch your site in terminal about once per minute (opening site in terminal counts to import/export zip rate limit which is currently 1 time per 1 minute (2 times for donators))
  >
  > i extremely recommend you watch video i made about me building demo Svelte app using Nekoweb Terminal to see how cool this thing is: https://lune.dimden.dev/4085d4ed0d4a.mp4 (video embed below)
  >
  > theres also 2 more cool features:
  > 
  > * you can now remove .html from your links! this was a very requested feature and now its here, you can enable this in site settings
  > * theres now support for setting custom HTTP headers for donators, also in settings!
  >
  > while NekoVM is still Beta, this update log marks Nekoweb Release&#x2122;, yea if u didnt notice nekoweb was still beta all this time. nekoweb has been running for almost 2 months now and most of issues have been fixed and things seem to run nicely. i hope itll continue to be this way

# Custom domain(s)
With Nekoweb, you have the ability to add your own custom domain(s) to
your site. You need to be a donator to do this.

You can have a maximum of 10 custom domains on one account.

You can have subdomains on your own custom domain(s).

## What is a subdomain?
A subdomain is a prefix to a domain name, like:
`https://subdomain.domain.tld`.

## Nekoweb subdomain
On Nekoweb, when registering an account, your username becomes the
subdomain of the domain nekoweb.org (like [wiki.nekoweb.org](/)),
what points to your site.

As donator, you can claim multiple subdomains.

## Types of subdomains on Nekoweb
Nekoweb supports 3 types of subdomains: Text only, Numbers only, Text
and numbers, and dashed.

## Nested subdomains on Nekoweb
You can add nested subdomains as a Nekoweb subdomain (As of 14/5/24),
but they does not work when trying to access them, and give this
error:

## Character Limit

## Punycode

Punycode is not supported in nekoweb subdomains.
