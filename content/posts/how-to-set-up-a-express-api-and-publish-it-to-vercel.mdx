In this post, I’ll walk you through how to set up an Express.js API, enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and deploy it to Vercel. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Express.js Project

First, you need to create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js application.

```bash
mkdir my-express-api
cd my-express-api
npm init -y
```

Next, install Express and the CORS middleware:

```bash
npm install express cors
```

## Step 2: Create Your Express Server

Create a file named `server.js` and set up a basic Express server with some routes.

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Enable CORS
app.use(cors());

// Middleware to parse JSON requests
app.use(express.json());

// Sample route
app.get('/api/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from the Express server!' });
});

// Start the server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## Step 3: Enable CORS

The `cors` middleware is now included in your application. It allows you to handle cross-origin requests smoothly. By default, this will enable CORS for all routes in your application, but you can also customize it by passing options.

```javascript
const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'https://your-frontend-url.com', // Replace with your frontend URL
  optionsSuccessStatus: 200, // For legacy browser support
};

app.use(cors(corsOptions));
```

## Step 4: Test Your API Locally

To test your API, run the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

You can now access your API at `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`. Use a tool like Postman or curl to see the JSON response.

## Step 5: Prepare for Vercel Deployment

Create a `vercel.json` file in your project directory to specify configuration settings for Vercel.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "server.js" }
  ]
}
```

## Step 6: Deploy to Vercel

If you haven't already, install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Log in or sign up for a Vercel account:

```bash
vercel login
```

Now, deploy your application using:

```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts to set up your project. Vercel will automatically detect your `vercel.json` configuration and deploy your API.

## Step 7: Test Your Deployed API

Once deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL for your newly deployed API. Access `https://your-vercel-url/api/hello` in your browser or Postman, and you should see the JSON response.

## Conclusion

You've successfully created an Express API, enabled CORS, and deployed it to Vercel. This lightweight setup is perfect for serving data to your frontend applications. You can extend the API by adding more routes and integrating with databases as needed.
