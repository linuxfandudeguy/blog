Imagine you are in the World Trade Center in New York City, and then all of a sudden you hear an explosion, and then the entire building catches on fire.

This is what people in the World Trade Center experienced on **September 11, 2001**.

On this tragic date, terrorist group known as Al-Qaeda hijacked four planes and purposely crashed them into government places, two of those planes crashed into the **World Trade Center**.

Underneath is a tribute about 9/11:
