<strong>A blog with Next.js 13 app dir, Contentlayer, Tailwind CSS and dark mode.</strong>

# this is my blog

My blog was cloned from a vercel template and I fell in love with it because it was more customizable then Blogger, but the designs were good enough so it didn't need any customization.

Here is the templete repo url:

# story

I was just casually scrolling around in Next.js Vercel deployment templates, when all of a sudden I came across `nextjs-contentlayer`.
I cloned it to a private repository, and begin making changes.
I immediately fell in love with this thing, originally my blog was on blogger and looked... still good but not as good.

###### A picture of my old blog, which I will keep up for occasional posts located at     <a href="https://lelbois.blogspot.com/">https://lelbois.blogspot.com/</a>

My new blog is **loaded** with stuff, Tailwind, Next.js, 

Oh yeah, did I mention that the blogs posts are written with `MDX`, (Markdown's Version of JSX) and the layouts are written with TypeScript JSX.

This is also **linted** Because if you look in the contents of the <a href="https://github.com/shadcn/next-contentlayer/">repo</a>, you can see a `.eslintrc.json` file which is the main configuration file for `eslint`, Also the file is only **3 lines long**.

```json
{
  "extends": "next/core-web-vitals"
}
```
This is just stuff generated by Next.js.

This is absolutely unbelievable, I love it!

Not only that, the pages are automatically generated and listed on the `index` blog page, this has to be the best thing I have ever seen done with Vercel, without any backend application.

You should use it for your blog now.
